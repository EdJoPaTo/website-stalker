## [Unreleased]

### Added

- new editor: `css_flatten`

## [0.24.2] - 2024-08-16

### Fixed

- Improve output on errors, especially HTTP request errors

## [0.24.1] - 2024-08-14

### Added

- support for CSS :has and :is (due to updated dependencies)

## [0.24.0] - 2024-06-13

### Added

- new editor: `css_sort`
- new editor: `debug_files`

### Fixed

- RSS: improve content_editors error output

## [0.23.0] - 2024-05-14

### Added

- Show used HTTP version in the output (`HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2.0`, …)
- `http1_only` option to force usage of `HTTP/1`

### Changed

- Move notifications from environment variables to CLI. Can still be configured via environment variables, but they have different names now. Check --help.
- Document `WEBSITE_STALKER_FROM` in `--help`. Also allows for `--from`
- RSS: remove website-stalker version from the generator field
- Improve error handling by instant panic or cleaner human error message
- Deprecate `init` sub-command. Its more transparent to use `git init && website-stalker example-config > website-stalker.yaml`
- Deprecate `check` sub-command. `run` also checks the config and additionally runs it when correct which most people probably need.

### Breaking Changes

- Environment variable names for notifications differ and can now also be provided via --flags. Check --help.
- Error on notification_template in config. Notification configuration changed and is likely not working anymore, so hard error over a warning.

## [0.22.0] - 2024-02-13

### Added

- Automatically generated man pages from the CLI definition

### Changed

- `rss` uses the first title / heading element as RSS title (was only title before)
- Improve error output message on editor error
- `json_prettify` uses tabs instead of spaces now for better accessibility and smaller file sizes (`html_prettify` does the same)
- Show warnings for deprecated field usage in notification mustache template
- Show warning on `rss` without title (neither from explicit configuration nor the input HTML)

### Fixed

- Correctly detect duplicate hosts for delays between them (to reduce load on the host)
- systemd service is `Type=oneshot` now and can no longer be installed. The timer is the relevant unit and not the service.

## [0.21.0] - 2023-09-05

### Changed

- Files are sorted into folders of their domains

## [0.20.0] - 2023-04-11

### Changed
