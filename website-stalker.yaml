# This is an example config
# The filename has to be `website-stalker.yaml`
# and it has to be in the working directory where you run website-stalker.
#
# Adapt the config to your needs and set the FROM email address which is used as a request header:
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/From
#
# Check if your config is valid via `website-stalker check`.
# And then do a run via `website-stalker run --all`.
#
#
# In this example, the website `edjopato.de` is tracked.
# In particular, the `robots.txt`, as a minimal example of a `sites` target,
# and the list of blogposts in `/post/`. Here, the use of `editors` is shown.
# The `css_select` option specifies that all html tags within the `.content` class should be tracked.
# Then all `a` tags (links) are removed.
# Finally, `regex_replace` demonstrates how to replace the occurrence of time and date with the
# name of their standard.
