# Website Stalker

> Track changes on websites via git

This tool checks all the websites listed in its config.
When a change is detected, the new site is added to a git commit.
It can then be inspected via normal git tooling.

Basically its `curl`, [`sed`++](#editors) and then `git commit` in a neat package.

See it [in action](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker-example) (literally in GitHub **Action**s).

## Install

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker/releases)
- [Arch Linux User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/website-stalker/)
- [Docker Hub Image ![Docker Hub Image](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/edjopato/website-stalker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/edjopato/website-stalker)
- Via rust and cargo: Clone â†’ `cargo install --path .`

## Usage

### GitHub Actions

Check out [website-stalker-example](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker-example) which runs within GitHub actions.

### Locally

- First create a new folder / repo for tracking website changes
    ```bash
    mkdir personal-stalker
    cd personal-stalker
    website-stalker init
    ```

    `website-stalker init` will create a git repo (`git init`) and the example config (`website-stalker example-config > website-stalker.yaml`) for you.

- Add your favorite website to the config file `website-stalker.yaml`.
    Also make sure to set the value of [from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/From) to an email address of yours.

    ```bash
    website-stalker example-config > website-stalker.yaml
    nano website-stalker.yaml
    ```

- Check if your config is valid
    ```bash
    website-stalker check
    ```

- Run your newly added website. If you added `https://apple.com/newsroom` use something like this to test if everything works like you want:
    ```bash
    website-stalker run apple
    ```

- Set up a cronjob / [systemd.timer](systemd) executing the following command every now and then
    ```bash
    website-stalker run --all --commit
    ```

### Config Example

The config describes a list of sites.
Each site has a URL.
Additionally, each site can have editors which are used before saving the file.
Each [editor](#editors) manipulates the content of the URL.

```yaml
# This is an example config
# The filename should be `website-stalker.yaml`
# and it should be in the working directory where you run website-stalker.
#
# For example run `website-stalker example-config > website-stalker.yaml`.
# Adapt the config to your needs and set the FROM email address which is used as a request header:
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/From
#
# And then do a run via `website-stalker run --all`.
---
from: my-email-address
sites:
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/post/"
    editors:
      - css_select: article
      - css_remove: a
      - html_prettify
      - regex_replace:
          pattern: "(Lesezeit): \\d+ \\w+"
          replace: $1
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/robots.txt"
```

There is a bigger [config](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker-example/blob/main/website-stalker.yaml) in my [example repo](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker-example).
The example repo is also used by me to detect changes of interesting sites.

### Global Config Options

Options which are globally configured at the root level of the configuration file `website-stalker.yaml`.

#### FROM

FROM is used as a [FROM header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/From) on the web requests.
It is a required field.

The idea here is to provide a way for a website hosts to contact whoever is doing something to their web server
As this tool is self-hosted and can be run as often as the user likes this can annoy website hosts.
While this tool is named "stalker" and is made to track websites it is not intended to annoy people.

This tool sets the [USER-AGENT header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) always to `website-stalker/<version> https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker` and the [FROM header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/From) to the config value.
This way both the creator and the user of this tool can be reached in case of problems.

```yaml
from: my-email-address
```

### Per Site Config Options

Options available per site besides the [editors](#editors) which are explained below.

#### url

One or multiple URLs can be specified.
The simple form is a single URL:

```yaml
sites:
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/"
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/post/"
```

It's also possible to specify multiple URL at the same time.
This is helpful when multiple sites are sharing the same options (like editors).

```yaml
sites:
  - url:
      - "https://edjopato.de/"
      - "https://edjopato.de/post/"
```

#### accept_invalid_certs

Allows HTTPS connections with self-signed or invalid / expired certificates.

From [reqwests documentation](https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.11.4/reqwest/struct.ClientBuilder.html#method.danger_accept_invalid_certs):

> You should think very carefully before using this method. If
> invalid certificates are trusted, *any* certificate for *any* site
> will be trusted for use. This includes expired certificates. This
> introduces significant vulnerabilities, and should only be used
> as a last resort.

Do you have a need for self-signed certificates or the usage of the system certificate store?
Please share about it in [Issue #39](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker/issues/39).

```yaml
sites:
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/post/"
    accept_invalid_certs: true
```

### Editors

Editors are manipulating the content of a webpage to simplify comparing them later on.

For example: If you are interested in the content of a webpage the `<head>` with changing stylesheets isn't interesting to you.
When keeping it, it will still create diffs which end up being commits.
This will create noise you're probably just going to ignore.
That's why editors exist.

Think of editors like a pipeline, the next one gets the input of the one before.
As some editors are assuming HTML input, they won't work (well) with non HTML input.
For example its kinda useless to use `html_prettify` after `html_textify` as text won't end up being pretty HTML.
For this reason editors like `css_select` are still producing valid HTML output.

There are probably more tasks out there that might be useful as editors.
Feel free to provide an issue for an editor idea or create a Pull Request with a new editor.

#### css_remove

Tries to remove every instance of matching HTML elements and returns the remaining HTML.
Opposite of [`css_select`](#css_select).

Examples:

```yaml
editors:
  - css_remove: article
  - css_remove: h1 a
  - css_remove: h1 > a
```

#### css_select

Tries to grab every instance of matching HTML elements and returns all of them (in a still valid HTML).
Optionally with a `remove: true` it returns everything excluding the matching HTML elements.

If no matching HTML elements are found, this editor fails.

Examples:

```yaml
editors:
  - css_select: article
  - css_select: h1 a
  - css_select: h1 > a
```

#### html_markdownify

Formats the input HTML as Markdown.

This is rather simple right now.
Please report issues you find.

Example:

```yaml
editors:
  - html_markdownify
```

#### html_prettify

Formats the input HTML as pretty HTML.

Example:

```yaml
editors:
  - html_prettify
```

#### html_textify

Only returns text content of HTML elements within the input.

Example:

```yaml
editors:
  - html_textify
```

#### html_url_canonicalize

Parses the input HTML for URLs.
URLs are parsed into their canonical, absolute form.

Example:

```yaml
editors:
  - html_url_canonicalize
```

#### json_prettify

Formats the input JSON as pretty JSON.

Example:

```yaml
editors:
  - json_prettify
```

#### regex_replace

Searches the input with a Regex pattern and replaces all occurrences with the given replace phrase.
Grouping and replacing with `$1` also works.

Examples:

```yaml
editors:
  # Remove all occurences of that word
  - regex_replace:
    pattern: "tree"
    replace: ""
  # Remove all numbers
  - regex_replace:
    pattern: "\\d+"
    replace: ""
  # Find all css files and remove the extension
  - regex_replace:
    pattern: "(\\w+)\\.css"
    replace: $1
```

#### rss

Creates an RSS 2.0 Feed from the input.
An RSS item is generated for every `item_selector` result.
The other selectors can be used to find relevant information of the items.
The content is the full result of the `item_selector`.
It can be further edited with every available [editor](#editors).

Defaults:
- `title`: When a `<title>` exists, it will be used. Otherwise, it's empty.
- `item_selector`: `article`
- `title_selector`: `h2`
- `link_selector`: `a`
- `content_editors` can be omitted when empty

Examples:

```yaml
  # Fully specified example
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/post/"
    editors:
      - rss:
          title: EdJoPaTos Blog
          item_selector: article
          title_selector: h2
          link_selector: a
          content_editors:
            - css_select:
                selector: "h2, article > a, div"
                remove: true
            - html_textify

  # Minimal working example
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/post/"
    editors:
      - rss: {}
```
