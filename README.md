# Website Stalker

> Track changes on websites via git

This tool checks all the websites listed in its config.
When a change is detected, the new site is added to a git commit.
It can then be inspected via normal git tooling.

Basically its `curl`, [`sed`++](#editors) and then `git commit` in a neat package.

See it [in action](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker-example) (literally in GitHub **Action**s).

## Install

- [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker/releases)
- [Arch Linux User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/website-stalker/)
- [Docker Hub Image ![Docker Hub Image](https://img.shields.io/docker/image-size/edjopato/website-stalker)](https://hub.docker.com/r/edjopato/website-stalker)
- Via rust and cargo: Clone â†’ `cargo install --path .`

## Usage

### GitHub Actions

Check out [website-stalker-example](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker-example) which runs within GitHub actions.

### Locally

- First create a new folder / repo for tracking website changes
    ```bash
    mkdir personal-stalker
    cd personal-stalker
    git init
    ```

- Create the config file which contains all the websites to be stalked.
    Add your favorite website.
    Also make sure to set the value of [from](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/From) to an email address of yours.

    ```bash
    website-stalker example-config > website-stalker.yaml
    nano website-stalker.yaml
    ```

- Check if your config is valid
    ```bash
    website-stalker check
    ```

- Run your newly added website. If you added `https://apple.com/newsroom` use something like this to test if everything works like you want:
    ```bash
    website-stalker run apple
    ```

- Set up a cronjob / systemd.timer executing the following command every now and then
    ```bash
    website-stalker run --all --commit
    ```

### Config Example

The config describes a list of sites.
Each site has a URL and a file extension which is used to save the file.
Additionally, each site can have editors which are used before saving the file.
Each [editor](#editors) manipulates the content of the URL.

```yaml
# This is an example config
# The filename should be `website-stalker.yaml`
# and it should be in the working directory where you run website-stalker.
#
# For example run `website-stalker example-config > website-stalker.yaml`.
# And then do a run via `website-stalker run`.

from: my-email-address
sites:
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/post/"
    extension: html
    editors:
      - css_select: article
      - css_select:
          selector: a
          remove: true
      - html_prettify
      - regex_replace:
          pattern: "(Lesezeit): \\d+ \\w+"
          replace: $1
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/robots.txt"
    extension: txt
```

There is a bigger [config](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker-example/blob/main/website-stalker.yaml) in my [example repo](https://github.com/EdJoPaTo/website-stalker-example).
The example repo is also used by me to detect changes of interesting sites.

### Editors

Editors are manipulating the content of a webpage to simplify comparing them later on.

For example: If you are interested in the content of a webpage the `<head>` with changing stylesheets isn't interesting to you.
When keeping it, it will still create diffs which end up being commits.
This will create noise you're probably just going to ignore.
That's why editors exist.

Think of editors like a pipeline, the next one gets the input of the one before.
As some editors are assuming HTML input, they won't work (well) with non HTML input.
For example its kinda useless to use `html_prettify` after `html_textify` as text won't end up being pretty HTML.
For this reason editors like `css_select` are still producing valid HTML output.

There are probably more tasks out there that might be useful as editors.
Feel free to provide an issue for an editor idea or create a Pull Request with a new editor.

#### css_select

Tries to grab every instance of matching HTML elements and returns all of them (in a still valid HTML).
Optionally with a `remove: true` it returns everything excluding the matching HTML elements.

If no matching HTML elements are found, this editor fails.

Examples:

```yaml
editors:
  - css_select: article
  - css_select:
      selector: article
  - css_select:
      selector: a
      remove: true
  - css_select: h1 a
  - css_select: h1 > a
```

#### html_markdownify

Formats the input HTML as Markdown.

This is rather simple right now.
Please report issues you find.

Example:

```yaml
editors:
  - html_markdownify
```

#### html_prettify

Formats the input HTML as pretty HTML.

Example:

```yaml
editors:
  - html_prettify
```

#### html_textify

Only returns text content of HTML elements within the input.

Example:

```yaml
editors:
  - html_textify
```

#### regex_replace

Searches the input with a Regex pattern and replaces all occurrences with the given replace phrase.
Grouping and replacing with `$1` also works.

Examples:

```yaml
editors:
  # Remove all occurences of that word
  - regex_replace:
    pattern: "tree"
    replace: ""
  # Remove all numbers
  - regex_replace:
    pattern: "\\d+"
    replace: ""
  # Find all css files and remove the extension
  - regex_replace:
    pattern: "(\\w+)\\.css"
    replace: $1
```

#### rss

Creates an RSS 2.0 Feed from the input.
An RSS item is generated for every `item_selector` result.
The other selectors can be used to find relevant information of the items.
The content is the full result of the `item_selector`.
It can be further edited with every available [editor](#editors).

Defaults:
- `title`: When a `<title>` exists, it will be used. Otherwise, it's empty.
- `item_selector`: `article`
- `title_selector`: `h2`
- `link_selector`: `a`
- `content_editors` can be omitted when empty

Examples:

```yaml
  # Fully specified example
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/post/"
    extension: xml
    editors:
      - rss:
          title: EdJoPaTos Blog
          item_selector: article
          title_selector: h2
          link_selector: a
          content_editors:
            - css_select:
                selector: "h2, article > a, div"
                remove: true
            - html_textify

  # Minimal working example
  - url: "https://edjopato.de/post/"
    extension: xml
    editors:
      - rss: {}
```
